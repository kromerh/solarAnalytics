    "The way this pipeline will be laid out is that the DarkSky API is called and returns hourly, historical data for each day that is requested. The response from the API in the form of json files will be stored locally and then be processed into one big csv file with all the data from the API. For the final purpose of this dataset, the forecasting of photovoltaic energy production, not all of the data in DarkSky must be relevant. "
